# TwitterClone Mobile Application

## Project Overview

This project is a Twitter clone mobile application built for Android using Kotlin. It aims to replicate the core features of Twitter, allowing users to post tweets, follow other users, view personalized timelines, and interact with content. The application is designed to provide a smooth and responsive user experience, with a focus on efficient data handling through caching.

The target audience for this application includes:

*   Individuals interested in experiencing a simplified version of Twitter.
*   Developers looking for a practical example of Android app development with Kotlin.
*   Anyone interested in exploring mobile application architecture, particularly caching strategies.

## Features

*   **Tweet Posting:** Users can compose and post tweets with text.
*   **User Following:** Users can follow other users to see their tweets in their timeline.
*   **Timeline View:** Displays a chronological feed of tweets from users the current user follows.
*   **User Profiles:** Users can view profiles of other users, including their tweets and follower information.
*   **Caching:** Implements a caching mechanism to store frequently accessed data locally, improving performance and reducing network requests. This includes caching tweets and user data.
*   **User Authentication:** (To be implemented) Secure user registration and login functionality.
*   **Search:** (To be implemented) Ability to search for users and tweets.

## Technology Stack

*   **Kotlin:** The primary programming language for Android development.
*   **Android SDK:** The software development kit for building Android applications.
*   **Caching Libraries:** (Specify the exact libraries used, e.g., `Room Persistence Library`, `Android Caching Library`).  Example: We are using `Room Persistence Library` for local data storage and caching.
*   **Retrofit:** (If used) A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.  Example: We are using `Retrofit` to make API requests to the backend.
*   **Coroutines:** (If used) For asynchronous programming to handle background tasks and improve UI responsiveness. Example: We are using `Coroutines` to handle network requests asynchronously.
*   **Glide/Picasso:** (If used) For image loading and caching. Example: We are using `Glide` for efficient image loading.

## Setup Instructions

> Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
>
> *   Android Studio (latest version)
> *   Android SDK
> *   Git

1.  **Clone the repository:**

        *   Launch Android Studio.
    *   Select "Open an Existing Project" and navigate to the cloned repository.

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    > Android Studio should automatically prompt you to sync the project with Gradle files. If not, select `File` -> `Sync Project with Gradle Files`.

    *   Alternatively, you can manually build the project: `Build` -> `Make Project`.

4.  **Configure the Application:**

kotlin
    > // Example in build.gradle (Module: app)
    > android {
    >     defaultConfig {
    >         buildConfigField("String", "API_BASE_URL", "\"https://api.example.com/\"")
    >     }
    > }
    >     *   Connect an Android device or start an emulator.
    *   Click the "Run" button in Android Studio to build and run the application on your device/emulator.

## Usage

1.  **Creating an Account:**

    > (Assuming user authentication is implemented) On the welcome screen, tap "Sign Up" and provide the required information (username, email, password).

2.  **Posting Tweets:**

    *   Tap the "+" button or the "Tweet" icon.
    *   Compose your tweet in the text field.
    *   Tap the "Post" button to publish your tweet.

3.  **Following Users:**

    *   Navigate to a user's profile.
    *   Tap the "Follow" button.
    *   You will now see their tweets in your timeline.

4.  **Viewing Timeline:**

    *   The main screen displays your timeline, showing tweets from users you follow in chronological order.
    *   Pull to refresh the timeline to see new tweets.

## Caching Strategy

The application utilizes a caching strategy to improve performance and reduce network load.  Frequently accessed data, such as tweets and user profiles, are stored locally using `Room Persistence Library`.

*   **Data Cached:** Tweets, user profiles, and potentially media files (images, videos).
*   **Caching Mechanism:**
    *   When the application requests data, it first checks the local cache.
    *   If the data is available in the cache and is still valid (not expired), it is retrieved from the cache.
    *   If the data is not in the cache or has expired, the application fetches it from the network.
    *   The fetched data is then stored in the cache for future use.
*   **Cache Invalidation:**  The cache is invalidated under certain conditions:
    *   When new tweets are posted.
    *   When user profiles are updated.
    *   Periodically based on a predefined time interval.

Refer to `CacheModel.kt` for the data models used for caching tweets and `CacheUserModel.kt` for the data models used for caching user information.  These files define the structure of the cached data and the relationships between them.

> 1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:** `git checkout -b feature/new-feature` or `git checkout -b fix/bug-fix`.
3.  **Make your changes and commit them with descriptive commit messages.**
4.  **Test your changes thoroughly.**
5.  **Submit a pull request to the `main` branch.**

> When submitting a pull request, please ensure that:
